# Maana Command Line Interface (CLI)

Here is a step-by-step example of an end-to-end flow of creating a domain model, hydrating it with instances, and querying it, all programmatically, using the standard [graphql-cli ](https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli)utility and the custom Maana plugin.

Sample code can be found here: [https://github.com/maana-io/Q-tutorials/tree/master/cli](https://github.com/maana-io/Q-tutorials/tree/master/cli).

It is published as an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-cli-maana).

It is best to make a copy of this repo (delete the .git folder to detach it from GitHub). Then you can make all the changes you want, check it into a different repo, etc.

## Installation

```sh
npm i -g graphql-cli graphql-cli-maana
```

## Setup

The CLI uses a [standard configuration format](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-config/blob/master/specification.md), .graphqlconfig. The purpose is to provide configurations for the CLI tool.

The tutorial repo you cloned above includes a sample .graphqlconfig. It might be easier to edit it, but, if you wish, you can create your own by (deleting it and) following the instructions below.

The config consists of:

- **projects** : these are equivalent to Maana "service name" and tell the CLI where to find the schema for the endpoint
- **endpoints** : these are the "service endpoint URLs"

For consistency and simplicity, we recommend you use the same name for the **Maana service** , the **project** , and the **endpoint** (e.g., "ckg", "basic", "projectX").

To create a configuration from scratch, create a CKG project and GraphQL endpoint, as in:

```bash
gql init
? Enter project name (Enter to skip): ckg
? Local schema file path: ckg.graphql
? Endpoint URL (Enter to skip): https://<maana host>:8443/graphql
? Name of this endpoint, for e.g. default, dev, prod: (default)
? Subscription URL (Enter to skip):
? Do you want to add other endpoints? No
? What format do you want to save your config in? JSON

About to write to /home/me/maana/training/.graphqlconfig:

{
  "projects": {
    "ckg": {
      "schemaPath": "ckg.graphql",
      "extensions": {
        "endpoints": {
          "default": "https://<maana host>:8443/graphql"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

? Is this ok? Yes
```

## Authentication with Maana

Maana endpoints require a valid (authenticated) user in order to prevent unauthorized access.

### <a name="v3.1.0"></a>Maana Q v3.1.0 and later

After creating a new `.graphqlconfig` file connecting to a Maana API endpoint:

- Login to the Maana Knowledge Portal
- Click on your user icon and select your profile
- At the bottom of the profile page click the 'Get CLI Authentication Token' button
- Go through the login process (again)
- Copy the generated auth token that shows up below the button
- In the terminal run `gql msignin` and when asked paste the Authentication Token into the prompt
- Run `gql menv --shell <your shell>` in the current terminal window to run authenticated GraphQL calls.
  - Example: Run `gql menv --shell bash` if you are using bash
  - You will see output similar to:
    ```
    export MAANA_AUTH_TOKEN=<token here>
    # Run this command to configure your shell
    # eval $(gql menv --shell bash)
    ```
  - Now run the command it asks you to at the bottom of the output
- Run `gql ping` to test out that the authentication works (you will get an error if it did not)

#### Additional Notes

- When you add another project to your `.graphqlconfig` file you can run `gql maddheaders --project <Project Name>` to add the headers to the new project.
- When you want to run the CLI against the Maana API in a different terminal window you will need to run `gql env` again.
- If your authentication token expires you can run `gql mrefreshauth` to refresh the authentication token, when the Maana API is configured to allow the refreshing of authentication tokens.

### <a name="v3.0.5"></a>Maana Q v3.0.5

After creating a new project connecting to a Maana endpoint, you will need to setup the project to add an authentication header to the requests.

- Login to the Maana Knowledge Portal
- Click on your user icon and select your profile
- At the bottom of the profile page click the 'Get CLI Authentication Token' button
- Go through the login process (again)
- Copy the generated auth token that shows up below the button
- In the terminal add an environment variable for the auth token

```sh
# *nix based systems
export MAANA_AUTH_TOKEN=<paste auth token here>
```

```bat
rem Windows command line
set MAANA_AUTH_TOKEN=<paste auth token here>
```

```ps1
# Windows power shell
$Env:MAANA_AUTH_TOKEN = "<paste auth token here>"
```

Add the authorization header to the Maana endpoint:

```diff
     "ckg": {
      "schemaPath": "ckg.graphql",
       "extensions": {
         "endpoints": {
-           "default": "https://<maana host>:8443/graphql"
+           "default": {
+             "url": "https://<maana host>:8443/graphql",
+             "headers": {
+               "Authorization": "Bearer ${env:MAANA_AUTH_TOKEN}"
+             }
+           }
         }
       }
     }
```

## Create the Model

Let's first define a simple schema to use, e.g., model.gql:

```graphql
type Person {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  dob: String
  employer: Employer
}

type Employer {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  ceo: Person
}
```

## Create the Service

Now that we've defined our model, we would like Maana to manage it for us (i.e., create a graph and all of the boilerplate operations, such as add, updating, and deleting instances, querying them, generating events, etc.).

Execute the **maddsvc** ("add service") command, which takes the **service name** and the **GraphQL model** definition (i.e., your types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions):

```bash
gql maddsvc Basic -s basic/model.gql -p ckg
Using endpoint default: {"url":"https://<maana host>:8443/graphql"}
Read file: basic/model.gql size: 136
Sending query:
  mutation addServiceSource($input: AddServiceSourceInput!) {
    addServiceSource(input: $input)
  }
  ...
âœ” Call succeeded:
{"addServiceSource":"1788c00e-3a29-4843-aa56-44ba374cf682"}
```

Take note of the generated service id, since we&#39;ll add it as a new GraphQL **endpoint** to your CLI configuration.

## Update the Config

Add another project to you graphql config using the following template to build your service url. Make sure that your url ends in `/graphql`.

Template:

```
https://<maana host>:8443/service/<service id>/graphql
```

Command:

```bash
gql add-project
? Enter project name for new project: basic
? Local schema file path: basic/basic.graphql
? Endpoint URL (Enter to skip): <service url>
? Name of this endpoint, for e.g. default, dev, prod: (default)
? Subscription URL (Enter to skip):
? Do you want to add other endpoints? No

Adding the following endpoints to your config:  basic
? Is this ok? Yes
```

Again, we need to add the authorization header.

- In Maana Q 3.1.0 or later just run the `gql maddheaders` command
- In Maana Q 3.0.5 will require adding it manually, check [here](#v3.0.5) for instructions.

## Introspecting the Service

Only a few types were specified for the **domain model**. Maana adds a set of boilerplate types and operations as part of a fully-managed service. The **schema** for this service can be retrieved by:

```bash
gql get-schema -p basic
```

## Creating Instance Data

Create instances from common data formats, such as CSV and JSON that conform to the model. The /basic examples of person and employer instance data are given below.

### Person.csv

```baash
"id","name","dob","employer"
"P00","Han Solo","1942-07-13","E00"
"P01","George Lucas","1944-05-14","E00"
```

### Employer.csv

```baash
"id","name","ceo"
"E00","Lucasfilm Ltd.","P01"
```

### Person.json

```json
[
  {
    "id": "P00",
    "name": "Han Solo",
    "dob": "1942-07-13",
    "employer": "E00"
  },
  {
    "id": "P01",
    "name": "George Lucas",
    "dob": "1944-05-14",
    "employer": "E00"
  }
]
```

### Employer.json

```json
[
  {
    "id": "E00",
    "name": "Lucasfilm Ltd.",
    "ceo": "P01"
  }
]
```

## Loading Instance Data

The above CSV and JSON data can be loaded by using the &#39;load&#39; GraphQL CLI command, passing the mutation to call, the data file, field mappings (if any). delimeters, etc.

```bash
gql mload basic/Person.json -p basic
gql mload basic/Employer.json -p basic
```

## Using Default Queries

The boilerplate for persisted models includes add/update/delete mutations as well as get by id and get batch by ids queries that can be used from GraphiQL, the CLI, or from any GraphQL client. For the above &#39;basic&#39; example, we define the below queries.

This is exactly the same format as you would use in GraphiQL ---- try cut-and-pasting the below into a GraphiQL session against your service.

### basicOps.gql

```graphql
fragment personDetail on Person {
  name
  dob
  employer {
    ...employerDetail
  }
}

fragment employerDetail on Employer {
  name
  ceo {
    name
  }
}

query person($id: ID!) {
  person(id: $id) {
    ...personDetail
  }
}

query allPersons {
  allPersons {
    ...personDetail
  }
}

query employer($id: ID!) {
  employer(id: $id) {
    ...employerDetail
  }
}

query allEmployers {
  allEmployers {
    ...employerDetail
  }
}
```

These queries can be invoked from the command line, such as:

```bash
gql query basic/basicOps.gql -p basic -o allEmployers
gql query basic/basicOps.gql -p basic -o person --variables "{\"id\":\"P01\"}"
```
